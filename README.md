# First Year Java Projects

This repository contains Java files and projects I developed during my first year at university. The code here reflects my learning progress and understanding of Java programming during that period. These projects include basic exercises, assignments, and small projects that cover fundamental concepts in programming and software development.

# Projects Overview

Below is a list of the main projects and topics covered in this repository:

	•	Basic Syntax and Data Types: Introduction to Java syntax, variables, data types, and operators.
	•	Control Structures: Conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while).
	•	Methods and Functions: Writing reusable methods and understanding method overloading.
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Introduction to classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
	•	File Handling: Reading from and writing to files using Java I/O classes.
	•	Data Structures: Implementing basic data structures like arrays, lists, and stacks.

Each file or folder includes a short description of the problem it solves or the concepts it focuses on.

Technologies Used

	•	Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or later is recommended to run these files.
	•	IDE: Most of the projects were developed using Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, but they can be run in any Java-compatible IDE.

How to Run the Code

	1.	Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-year-java-projects.git
cd first-year-java-projects


	2.	Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
	3.	Compile and run any of the Java files:
	•	In your IDE, right-click the file and select “Run” or “Run as Java Application.”
	•	Alternatively, from the command line, navigate to the file’s directory and use:

javac FileName.java
java FileName
